## Details
Online fashion shopping has become more and more popular in recent years. Consequently, enabling customers to virtually try on clothing will improve their shopping experience and change the way people shop for costumes while also saving businesses money. In order to give customers a better idea of how they will appear wearing a specific piece of clothing, our main idea is to create a virtual trial room that uses their image as input, processes it, and outputs an image of the user fitted with the costume. Users can virtually, as opposed to physically, try on clothing to verify one or more of the following: size, fit, or style. There are three primary methods used for this: <br>
<b>1. Pose Approximation<br>
2. Human Interpretation<br>
3. Online Measurement<br>
</b>

Open the [trial room](https://github.com/bislara/Virtual-Trial-Room/tree/master/Tryy-On)  folder for more details.

Also we have worked on 3D vision and pose estimation using monocamera. For more details open the [Real-Time-Pose-Estimation](https://github.com/bislara/Virtual-Trial-Room/tree/master/Size-Fit/Real-Time-Action-Recognition-with-gui) folder. 

We couldn't upload this to server as our storage requirements for models were more than 2.5GB and also we needed some powerful server, more than which was given in free suscription of AWS/Azure.
